Local Manifests for Samsung Galaxy Grand GT-I9082
This is a repo containing local manifests for compiling cm13 from source on Galaxy Grand GT-I9082.

On May,7,2016, This local manifest works well to compile cyanogenmod 13 from source and the compiled rom works well in tandem with deltagapps base with no bugs as of now.

I thank pawitp,ghsr,osas514 and all others who have contributed to the repos mentioned in the local manifest.

Special Thanks to @osas514 for instructions to compile. Without his help, this repo wouldn't exist
